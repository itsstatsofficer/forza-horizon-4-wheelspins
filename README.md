Forza Horizon 4 Wheelspins
==========================

Wheelspins is Forza Horizon's version of lootboxes.
To the best of my knowledge,
the odds are not published anywhere,
so I simply recorded a bunch of spins.


Format
------

The wheelspin results are recorded in order.

Every cash reward is a multiple of one thousand,
so they are simply recorded like "Rare: Credits - 130k".
Clothing is recorded like "Common: Clothing - All Black Canvas".

Cars have two options:
for cars that _can_ be purchased from the Autoshow,
I record their value and the name of the car
(like "Legendary: Car, worth 140k credits - 1956 Lotus Eleven").
Cars than _cannot_ be purchased from the Autoshow say "wheelspin only" after "Car"
("Common: Car, wheelspin only, worth 28k credits - 1993 Ford SVT Cobra R").
The value of the car comes from <https://forza.fandom.com/wiki/Forza_Horizon_4/Cars>.

I do not know the rarity of Forza Edition cars,
so I simply recorded them as "Forza Edition"
(e.g. "Forza Edition: Car, wheelspin only, worth 316k credits - 1980 Renault 5 Turbo Forza Edition").
