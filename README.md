Forza Horizon 4 Wheelspins
==========================

Wheelspins is Forza Horizon's version of lootboxes.
To the best of my knowledge,
the odds are not published anywhere,
so I simply recorded a bunch of spins.

The data is in [`wheelspin.md`](wheelspin.md).
The file format is described in [`processing.lisp`](processing.lisp),
which also contains tools for parsing and processing the data.
